# Topological SHAP Project

Previous work has used deep learning models to predict persistent homologyâ€“based representations of data. However, we still are not sure whether these models actually learn topological structure or are just overfit to the output vectorization. We evaluate this by analyzing which input regions most influence the predicted persistence landscape using SHAP.

We train a DenseNet-121 model to predict 300-dimensional persistence landscape vectors derived from cubical filtrations on grayscale versions of scene images. We then compare the SHAP attribution maps to the hole locations extracted from persistent homology alone.
